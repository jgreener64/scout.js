# scout.js
A chrome extension script that auto-highlights keywords on a web page and provides an informational pop-up on keyword hover.

**Installation** 

To use the scout.js extension in Chrome, navigate to <chrome://extensions/>. Make sure 'Developer mode' is ticked in the top right, then click the 'Load unpacked extension...' button and select the scout.js directory.

Whenever you make changes to the scout.js source files, ensure that you click 'Reload' (shortcut Ctrl+R) under the extension settings to update the changes. The extension loads automatically on every web page you visit, unless you uncheck 'Enable' in the extension settings.
